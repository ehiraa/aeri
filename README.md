## Features

- [x] Wide spread use, can be used across multiple servers and only needs one setup!
- [x] Extremely fast and built in logging

## Using Aeri

2.  Once setup the `.env` file, ensure you have both Docker, Docker Compose and NodeJS installed for your system
3.  Install pnpm `npm install -g pnpm`
4.  Run `pnpm all` and allow it to create and launch everything, seamlessly.
